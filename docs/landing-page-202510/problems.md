### Suggested approach (summary)
- Replace the single sub‑headline with a short evidence‑backed line or a rotating carousel of 3–5 short pain points users commonly report.  
- Replace separate “The Vision” and “The Gap Today” with a two-column, connected section: **What Good Singing Is** and **Where Teaching Falls Short**.  
- Use short, concrete microcopy and one actionable sentence that ties into your CTA.  
- Below are ready‑to‑paste headline/sub‑headline/carousel items, the reworked section copy, and UI notes for implementation.

### Evidence summary to motivate the copy
Common, repeatable complaints referenced in vocal pedagogy and user conversations include: 
- vocal fatigue and strained technique
- teachers focusing on tradition or rote methods instead of practical, incremental skill development
- beginners missing clear, stepwise guidance and feedback on what “good enough” looks like.

### Ready text to use (copy‑paste into your site)

#### Hero
- **Headline:** gaayak.org — Making Indian Singing Education Clear, Balanced, and Accessible  
- **Option A — Single sub‑headline (evidence‑driven):** Many learners struggle with strained technique, unclear feedback, and teaching that rewards memorization over practical skill.  
- **Option B — Carousel (preferred if you want variety):**
  1. “I get vocal fatigue but not lessons that explain why it happens”  
  2. “Teachers focus on exercises I don’t understand; I get no actionable feedback”  
  3. “Training often values tradition over usable skills for popular music”  
  4. “I’m not told what ‘good enough’ sounds like for my goals”  
  5. “Lessons feel one‑size‑fits‑all; nothing is adapted to my voice or goals”

Use Option B as a subtle auto‑rotating text carousel in the subhead area with pause on hover.

### Reworked middle section (connects “good singing” to the gap)

#### What Good Singing Is
Good singing is a set of measurable, improvable skills:
- **Controlled breathing** that supports phrases  
- **Stable pitch** across registers and transitions  
- **Healthy vocal tone** without strain  
- **Range and fluidity** for the songs you actually want to sing  
- **Expressive control** that shapes phrasing and style

#### Where Teaching Falls Short
Many current approaches leave learners without clear paths to improve:
- Teachers expect rote repetition without explaining the mechanics and trade‑offs.  
- Guidance often lacks stepwise milestones and objective feedback so learners cannot tell if they are improving.  
- High‑quality, balanced training is concentrated among classical streams and urban centers, making practical coaching inaccessible for many learners.

Concluding line to join the two columns:
- **Our approach:** map measurable skills to practical, trackable exercises so you can see and hear progress.

### UI and microcopy notes (implementation guidance)
- Use a short carousel component in the hero subhead if you want multiple user complaints visible. Keep each slide to one short sentence, auto‑advance every 4–5 seconds, include visible controls and pause on hover.  
- For the two‑column section, present **What Good Singing Is** on the left and **Where Teaching Falls Short** on the right, then a single full‑width row with **Our approach** and a small CTA.  
- Keep each bullet to 5–8 words for quick scanning. Use a slightly heavier weight for the lead phrase in each bullet (e.g., **Controlled breathing:** followed by short explanation).  
- Consider a subtle icon per bullet (breath/pitch/tone/range/style) to increase scannability.  
- In mobile, stack columns vertically with the “What Good Singing Is” first. Keep the carousel visible above the fold for immediate social proof of problems.

### Quick A/B test suggestions
- A vs B sub‑headline: test single evidence line (Option A) vs. carousel (Option B) for email signups.  
- Two‑column vs linear flow: test two‑column presentation against a single stacked section where each skill and gap is paired in a single card.

---

### Implementation snippets (short)
- **Carousel timing:** 4–5s auto, pause on hover, accessible controls (prev/next).  
- **CTA microcopy:** “Be the first to know” (primary); secondary: “Share your story” (feedback form link).  
- **Analytics event names:** hero_signup, hero_carousel_cta, feedback_submitted.

Use the copy above directly in your hero and middle section. The carousel lines and the two column texts are intentionally concise and evidence‑driven so you can iterate quickly without redesigning the whole page.
